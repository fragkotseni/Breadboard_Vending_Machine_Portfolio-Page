A latch is a type of memory device that stores a single bit of information. An SR latch has two inputs: S (Set) and R (Reset). It also has an output called Q. The S input is used to set the latch, while the R input resets it.

As shown in the table, this is how the SR latch operates.
However, by design, when both S and R are activated simultaneously, it results in an invalid input, making the value of Q undefined.

The circuit has two inputs: COIN and VEND. Pressing the COIN button simulates inserting a coin, while pressing the VEND button triggers the machine to dispense an item, indicated by an LED turning on.
